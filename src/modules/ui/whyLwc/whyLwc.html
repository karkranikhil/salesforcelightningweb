        Why Lightning Web Components (LWC)
    </div>

    <h3>1) Standard Development</h3>
    <div>
        Developers familiar with Web Components are mostly familiar with LWC
        out-of-the-box. Aura is proprietary, so the more you know about web
        standards, the more you'll have of a skill that can be used outside
        Salesforce, too!
    </div>

    <h3>2) Better Execution</h3>
    <div>
        LWC leverages built-in browser security features from WC standards, so
        there's less custom code. This means they run faster and are more
        consistent in how they enforce security. Also, events have a more
        limited scope, so there's much less processing required to handle
        events.
    </div>

    <h3>3) New Security Features</h3>
    <div>
        We get better CSS isolation, script isolation, DOM isolation, and a more
        limited event scope, all of which leads to more consistent component
        design.
    </div>

    <h3>4) ECMAScript ES6+</h3>
    <div>
        We now have better support for ES6 and ES7, not available in Aura. You
        can do more in less code. It also transpiles code to work with IE 11 and
        other browsers that are missing some features.
    </div>

    <h3>5) More Consistent Data Binding</h3>
    <div>
        Two-way data binding, which has always been kind of buggy in Aura, is
        gone. This forces developers to coordinate how data moves between
        components. This also means that data binding will work as expected,
        without the "gotchas" from Aura.
    </div>

    <h3>6) Service Components</h3>
    <div>
        You can now write components that have no UI. They simply provide
        reusable methods that you can use in other components. This is much more
        efficient than Static Resources.
    </div>

    <h3>7) Mixins</h3>
    <div>
        You can import accessible methods from other components (as per above),
        and also import specific Apex methods, even from multiple classes. In
        addition, the Apex methods can be cached for improved performance
