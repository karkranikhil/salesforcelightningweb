        Lightning Web Components (LWC)
    </div>

    <p>
        Lightning web components are custom HTML elements built using HTML and
        modern JavaScript.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Lightning Web Components uses core Web Components standards and
            provides only what’s necessary to perform well in browsers supported
            by <strong>Salesforce</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightning Web Components are lightweight and delivers exceptional
            performance Because it’s built on code that runs natively in
            browsers
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web Components</h2>
    <p>
        Web Components are a set of standards that allow us to write modular,
        reusable and encapsulated HTML elements. And the best thing about them:
        since they're based on web standards, we don't have to install any
        framework or library to start using them. You can start writing web
        components using vanilla javascript, right now!
    </p>

    <h2>Key concepts of Web components</h2>
    <div class="key-concept-section">
        <div><strong>1) Custom Elements</strong></div>
        <div>
            The Custom Elements api allows us to create our own DOM elements.
            Using this api, we can define a custom element, and inform the
            parser how to properly construct that element and how elements of
            that class should react to changes. Now you can create your own HTML
            element, like
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="key-concept-section">
        <div><strong>2) Shadow DOM</strong></div>
        <div>
            Shadow DOM gives us a way to encapsulate the styling and markup of
            our components. It's a sub DOM tree attached to a DOM element, to
            make sure none of our styling leaks out, or gets overwritten by any
            external styles. This makes it great for modularity.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="key-concept-section">
        <div><strong>3) ES Modules</strong></div>
        <div>
            The ES Modules specification defines the inclusion and reuse of JS
            documents in a standards based, modular, performant way.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="key-concept-section">
        <div><strong>4) HTML Templates</strong></div>
        <div>
            The HTML &lt;template&gt; tag allows us to write reusable chunks of
            DOM. Inside a template, scripts don't run, images don't load, and
            styling/mark up is not rendered. A template tag itself is not even
            considered to be in the document, until it's activated. HTML
            templates are great, because for every instance of our element, only
            1 template is used.
